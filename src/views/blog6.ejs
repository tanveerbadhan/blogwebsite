                    Also, this structure reminds of us the sacrifices made by thousands of soldiers who have given their lives during the first world war. The essay on India gate is an insight into this famous memorial in India. Whenever someone visits Delhi, they never miss the India gate. Thus, it has become one of the integral parts of Delhi and also a major tourist attraction. The locals as well as the tourists coming to visit Delhi flock this place all around the year. Also, for many locals, the sprawling lawns around the gate on both sides is a nice picnic spot.

                    It is very easy to reach the India gate as it is located centrally. Also, for winters, people pack their lunch and head to India gate along with their friends and families to spend the quality time. One can see children playing in these lawns along with elders sitting. The sight also looks good during the summer months. However, the most beautiful time to visit this place is in the night when it is illuminated fully with lights. </p>
